# Building a Cyberdeck - A Quest of Hacking the Matrix

"What's a **cyberdeck?**", you ask.

>"A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games that is used by hackers or 'Deckers' to temporarily connect their mind or 'jack in' to cyberspace. [...] In the real world, cyberdecks are **Artisan Crafted Computers** often powered by single board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic."

## Introduction
I have been working on this project for some time and decided I wanted to document the process while I work on the last steps to finish it.

Inspired by the technology in William Gibson's book *Neuromancer*, and the decks showcased on [cyberdeck.cafe](https://www.cyberdeck.cafe) and the [r/cyberdeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberdeck) subreddit, I crafted my own version of an *artisan crafted computer*. A dual screen, mechanical keyboard, Raspberry Pi powered "portable" computer, functionally similar to a low-end laptop but much cooler looking.

The shell of the deck is designed by me in Fusion360. The design includes a honeycomb grid that will be filled with individual hexagons printed in transparent PLA to allow RGB backlight pass-through.

The journey to this design was filled with many iterations and design tweaks. Currently, adjustments are being made to the spacing around the HDMI-in port to better accommodate cables.
