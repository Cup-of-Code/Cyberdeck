# Cyberdeck
### Below is an overview of my ongoing cyberdeck build###

IDEA: Inspired by the technology in William Gibson's book Neuromancer, a lot of people have been building their own version of a cyberdeck. What is a cyberdeck you ask? 
According to cyberdeck.cafe: 
  "A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace". "In the real world, cyberdecks are **Artisan Crafted Computers** often powered by single board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic."

Being inspired by the decks that are showcased on the website as well as the r/cyberdeck subreddit I came up with my own version of an artisian crafted computer. A dual screen, mechanical keyboard, Raspberry Pi powered "portable" computer. Below you can see an idea of what it could look like:

(This is approximately what it looks like now- with the exception that it is not in a working state atm)

The shell of the deck is designed by me in Fusion360 with the model looking like this:

(The honeycomb grip here will later be filled by individual hexagons printed in transparent PLA that will allow the passthrough of RGB backlight)
